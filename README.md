This Python program calculates gravitational time dilation near a black hole using the Schwarzschild metric. It allows the user to input the mass of the black hole and the distance of an observer or a falling object 
from it, then computes the corresponding Schwarzschild radius—the point beyond which nothing can escape. The user can choose whether to calculate the time experienced by the falling observer (as seen by a distant 
viewer) or the time experienced by the distant viewer (given the faller’s time). The program uses the formula :
      Rs = (2 * G * mass) / (c**2)
      t_prime = t / math.sqrt(1 - (v**2 / c**2))

 to show how time slows down near the event horizon, making Einstein’s concept of time dilation measurable and interactive through simple user inputs.
